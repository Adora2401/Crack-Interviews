    "(1) 本章按照数据结构分类一些问题，和之前按算法分类的题目相比可能会有重复，因为一道题可能有多个标签。\n",
    "(2) 对于每种数据结构，需要先学习掌握其基本原理，优缺点，复杂度，和对应语言中的API用法。对于其基本的实现方式也要了解。\n",
    "(3) Array，Matrix，String，Hash都是一些常用的数据结构，一般在各种题里都会用到，这里主要列举一些没有涉及到其他算法的题目。\n",
    "(4) Linked List往往自成一类，会涉及到一些pointer操作，需要细心。\n",
    "(5) Queue一般用在BFS里面比较多，这里不单独列举了。\n",
    "(6) Heap， Stack往往和其他知识点混用，但自己单独出题也可以。\n",
    "(7) Trie，Union Find， Sweep Line的套路比较明显，需要记住模板。\n",
    "(8) Binary Index Tree 和Segment Tree涉及到的题目有限，需要记住模板。Segment Tree解法一般来说可以覆盖BIT能解决的问题，但是BIT写起来短一些。\n",
    "(9) 复合数据结构里面LRU和LFU相对比较重要。其他的在掌握基本数据结构即复杂度之后，可以随机应变。"
